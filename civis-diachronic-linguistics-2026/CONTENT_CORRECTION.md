# Content Correction - Using ACTUAL Programme Data

## Problem
I had created completely fictional content:
- Moscow (St. Basil's Cathedral) image labeled as "Mediterranean"
- Hallucinated venue features (Computer Labs, Lecture Halls, etc.)
- Made-up content not from your actual programme

## Solution
Rebuilt homepage using your REAL programme content:
