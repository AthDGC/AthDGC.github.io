## Question: What does this presentation research focus on?


- What is the main architectural framework?
- How does it support linguistic research?
- What makes this approach unique?

---

## Textual Foundation & Computational Architecture

**A comprehensive approach to diachronic valency research**

The CVL-CDSAML project represents a novel integration of traditional philological expertise with modern computational linguistics. This corpus contains carefully curated historical texts that enable systematic analysis of how verb valency patterns evolve over time. The architecture supports both qualitative philological analysis and quantitative computational extraction of linguistic patterns.

---

## Question: Why do we need a comprehensive foundation for diachronic research?



- What challenges do historical linguists face?
- How does text quality affect research outcomes?
- What factors must be controlled?

---

## Introduction: The Need for a Comprehensive Foundation
Diachronic linguistic analysis requires careful consideration of multiple elements:
- **Text selection** and preparation
- Assessment of **historical evidence**
- Understanding **language development** contexts
- Recognition of **external factors** influencing linguistic change
Studying language change over millennia demands rigorous methodology in selecting and preparing texts. The CVL-CDSAML corpus addresses this need by establishing clear criteria for text inclusion and implementing systematic quality control measures. This foundation ensures that observed linguistic patterns reflect genuine historical developments rather than inconsistent data.

---

## Question: What exactly is the CVL-CDSAML Corpus?



- What does CVL-CDSAML stand for?
- How many texts does it contain?
- What time period does it cover?

---

## What is the CVL-CDSAML Corpus?
- **Purpose:** Foundation for a diachronic valency lexicon project
- **Scope:** historical texts covering **three millennia** of Greek language development
- **Inclusion:** Parallel traditions from **Germanic** and **Romance** languages
- **Approach:** Enables study of both internal and external language interactions
The CVL-CDSAML (Corpus for Valency Lexicon - Corpus of Diachronic and Synchronic Analyses of Multiple Languages) serves as the textual database for extracting valency information across languages and time periods. Each text is digitally encoded with linguistic annotations that enable automatic extraction of verb-argument structures. The corpus architecture supports both synchronic comparison across languages and diachronic tracking of changes within individual languages.

---

## Question: What research questions can this corpus address?


- Internal vs. external language development
- Genre and register effects
- Historical transmission problems

---

## Research Context & Methodology

The corpus allows researchers to analyze:

- **Internal language development** patterns
- **External language interactions** through contact
- **Genre effects** on linguistic features
- **Register variations** across time periods
- **Transmission problems** in historical linguistic evidence

The corpus is structured to allow comparison of the same text (e.g., Genesis 1) across five Greek translations spanning 2000 years, enabling precise tracking of how specific verbs like *ποιέω* "to make" change their argument structures over time.

---

## Question: Who funds this research and what is the timeline?


- Which foundation supports the project?
- What is the funding period?
- What makes this project competitive?

---

## Funding and Project Timeline

This competitive funding recognizes the innovative combination of traditional philological - linguistic methods with computational approaches. The grant enables hiring of researchers, acquisition of digital resources, and development of the computational infrastructure necessary for corpus processing and valency extraction.

---

## Question: What translation theory underlies this research?


- What is LCTT theory?
- How does translation affect language change?
- What is "translationese"?

---

## Language Contact Through Translation (LCTT)
**A Key Theoretical Framework:**
- Translation as a venue for **language contact** - Translations may introduce **source language features** into target languages- Creates a controlled environment for studying **contact-induced change**- Distinguishes between **direct** and **indirect** contact effects
LCTT theory, as developed by McLaughlin (2011) and others, provides a framework for understanding how translations serve as a unique form of language contact. Unlike spoken contact situations, translation creates a textual interface where source language structures may influence target language productions. This "translationese" effect can be measured and tracked over time, revealing patterns of influence that may eventually enter the (standard) target language.

---

## Question: What types of influential texts are included?



- What genres are represented?
- Why are these texts "influential"?
- What languages do they come from?

---

## Influential Texts in the Corpus
**Biblical and Religious Texts:**
- Hebrew Bible / Old Testament - Greek New Testament - Septuagint (Greek translation of Hebrew scriptures)
**Historical and Literary Works:**
- Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey* - Herodotus' *Histories* - Byzantine chronicles
**Why "Influential"?**
These texts shaped language use across centuries through liturgical reading, educational curricula, and cultural prestige. Their translation and retranslation created chains of linguistic influence traceable through the corpus.

---

## Question: How does the corpus handle multiple translations?



- What is "retranslation"?
- Why translate the same text multiple times?
- What can we learn from comparing translations?

---

## Multiple Translations and Retranslations
**The corpus includes:**
- **Original source texts** (Hebrew, Classical Greek) - **Multiple translations** of the same source into different target languages - **Retranslations** within the same language at different time periods
**Example: Genesis 1**
- Hebrew original - Septuagint (Greek, 150 BCE) - Byzantine Greek paraphrase - Modern Greek translation (20th century)
This structure enables tracking of how the same semantic content is expressed differently across time and languages.

---

## Question: What is the difference between passive and active retranslation?



- What motivates retranslation?
- When does the original translation become obsolete?
- What role do ideological factors play?

---

## Types of Retranslation
**Passive Retranslation:**
- Occurs when earlier translation is no longer accessible or intelligible - Language change makes original translation obsolete - Example: Modern Greek translations of the Septuagint
**Active Retranslation:**
- New translations created while earlier versions still accessible - Motivated by doctrinal, stylistic, or interpretive differences

 Example: Multiple English Bible versions in the 20th century
Both types provide valuable data for understanding language change and translation practices.

---

## Question: What specific retranslation examples does the corpus include?



- What Greek translations are included?
- What time span do they cover?
- How do they differ linguistically?

---

## Greek Biblical Retranslations in the Corpus

**Old Testament Translations:**
- **Septuagint** (c. 150 BCE) - **Aquila's translation** (2nd century CE) - **Byzantine paraphrases** (Medieval period) - **Modern Greek versions** (19th-20th century)

**New Testament:**
- **Original Greek** (1st-2nd century CE) - **Byzantine textual tradition** - **Modern Greek adaptations**

This range enables tracking of Greek language development from Hellenistic through Byzantine to Modern periods.

---

## Question: What is intralingual vs. interlingual translation?



- Translation within the same language vs. between languages
- When is intralingual translation necessary?
- What linguistic changes does it reveal?

---

## Intralingual and Interlingual Translation

**Interlingual Translation:**
- Translation **between different languages** - Example: Hebrew → Greek (Septuagint) - Reveals cross-linguistic contact effects

**Intralingual Translation:**
- Translation **within the same language** across time periods - Example: Koine Greek → Modern Greek - Reveals internal language change patterns

The corpus systematically includes both types to distinguish contact-induced change from natural language evolution.

---

## Question: Why is intralingual translation linguistically significant?


- What changes between language stages?
- How do translators update archaic features?
- What remains constant despite time?

---

## Significance of Intralingual Translation

**Intralingual translation reveals:**
- **Grammatical changes** (case system simplification) - **Lexical changes** (obsolete vocabulary replacement) - **Syntactic changes** (word order preferences) - **Stylistic changes** (register shifts)

**Research Value:**
- Controlled comparison (same semantic content) - Clear temporal boundaries - Identifiable translator decisions - Direct evidence of perceived archaism

When a translator updates "archaic" Greek to "modern" Greek, their choices reveal what features have become obsolete or marked.

---

## Passive Retranslation Explained

**Occurs when:** A previous translation becomes inaccessible or unintelligible to contemporary speakers


**Example: Modern Greek Translations of the Old Testament**

- The Septuagint (c. 150 BCE) became no longer intelligible to modern speakers
- This necessitated new translation work for contemporary audiences

---

## Active Retranslation Explained

**Occurs when:** New translations offer competing perspectives based on different theological, doctrinal, or interpretive preferences

**Example: English Bible Translations (19th-20th centuries)**

- Protestant versions
- Catholic versions
- Each reflecting different theological and doctrinal preferences

---

## Language Families in the Corpus

The CVL-CDSAML corpus includes texts from **three Indo-European language families:**

---

## The Three Language Families

1. **Hellenic**
   - Greek (across all historical periods)

2. **Germanic**

- From **synthetic structures** (morphologically complex)
- To **analytic structures** (syntactically complex)

**Key Research Question:** How and when did this shift occur?

*(Browning 1983; Horrocks 2010)*

---

## Dual Methodology Approach

**Philological Curation:**
- Expert text selection - Critical edition standards - Historical authenticity

**+**

**Computational Processing:**

- Systematic analysis - Large-scale pattern detection - Reproducible results

---

## Classical Greek Baseline

**Herodotus' *Histories* provides:**

- Evidence for **register variation** in Classical Greek
- Contextual baseline for **later developments**
- Comparison point for **linguistic change**



---

## The Koine Greek Core

**Foundation of the Early Corpus:**

- **Septuagint** (Greek Old Testament, c. 150 BCE)
- **New Testament** (1st-2nd century CE)
- Other Koine texts from the **Hellenistic and Roman periods**

---

## Significance of Koine Greek

**Why Koine is Central:**

- Transition period between Classical and Medieval Greek - Extensive **translation activity** (Hebrew → Greek) - **Widespread use** across the Mediterranean - Rich evidence for **language contact** phenomena - Foundation for **Byzantine** and **Modern Greek**

---

## Summary: A Comprehensive Resource

The CVL-CDSAML corpus provides:

- **More than 100 texts** across multiple languages - **Three millennia** of language history - **Systematic methodology** combining philology and computation - **Translation-based** approach to language contact - Foundation for **diachronic valency research**

- More **literary** Koine style - Classical influences - Sophisticated vocabulary

**Mark's Gospel:**
- More **colloquial** style - Simpler syntax - Oral narrative features


*Same content, different linguistic realizations*

---

## Byzantine Greek: The Medieval Transition

**Time Period:** 4th-15th centuries CE

**Key Changes:**

- Loss of **dative case** (replaced by prepositional phrases)
- Simplification of **infinitive** system
- Development of **periphrastic constructions**

---

## Example: Dative Case Replacement

**Classical/Koine Greek:**

```
τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ (tō anthrōpō)
"to the man" (dative case)
```

**Byzantine/Modern Greek:**

```
στον άνθρωπο (ston ánthropo)
"to the man" (preposition + accusative)
```

---

## Modern Greek in the Corpus

**Varieties Included:**
- **Katharevousa** (formal, archaic) - **Dimotiki** (vernacular, spoken) - Modern translations of ancient texts

**Research Focus:**

```
"Fiat lux" (let there be light)
```

**Influenced translations in:**

- French: "Que la lumière soit"
- Italian: "Sia la luce"
- Spanish: "Hágase la luz"

---

- What role did Latin play in French syntax?

---

## Question: What happens during text digitization?

**Digitization process:**

- How are printed texts digitized? 
- What quality control measures are in place?

---

## Computational Processing Pipeline

**Stage 1: Text Digitization**
- OCR for printed sources  - Quality verification (double-checking, error correction)

Digitization is the foundation of the entire project: physical texts must be converted to machine-readable format. For printed texts (19th-21st century), we use OCR technology trained on historical fonts; OCR output is manually reviewed. For manuscripts and early printed books, researchers create electronic editions preserving orthographic features. Some texts undergo re-digitization. The corpus includes metadata tracking digitization method and quality for each text.

---

## Question: What happens during linguistic annotation?

**Annotation layers:**

- How are words segmented?
- How are lemmas identified?
- How is morphology tagged?

---

## Computational Processing Pipeline (2)

**Stage 2: Linguistic Annotation**
- **Tokenization** (word segmentation using language-specific rules) - **Lemmatization** (dictionary form identification via lookup tables) - **Morphological tagging** (grammatical features: case, tense, number, etc.) - **Syntactic parsing** (sentence structure: dependency or constituent analysis)

Linguistic annotation adds layers of linguistic information to raw text. Tokenization segments text into words, handling clitics and contractions appropriately for each language. Lemmatization links inflected forms to lexicon entries (e.g., ἔδωκεν → δίδωμι). Morphological tagging assigns grammatical features using taggers trained on historical language data. Syntactic parsing identifies grammatical relations between words, which is crucial for valency extraction. All annotation undergoes manual quality control, with inter-annotator agreement.

---

## Question: How is the valency lexicon structured?

**Lexicon design:**

- What information does each entry contain?
- How are frames linked to examples?
- What enables complex queries?

---

## Computational Processing Pipeline (3)

**Stage 3: Valency Extraction**
- Identify predicates (verbs, adjectives, nouns requiring arguments) - Extract **argument structures** (what depends on the predicate) - Code **valency frames** (abstract patterns, e.g., NOM+ACC+DAT) - Track changes across time periods (compare frames diachronically)

Each predicate instance is checked for its arguments (subject, objects, complements, adjuncts), and these are abstracted into valency frames. For example, from 100 instances of δίδωμι in a Koine text, the system extracts frame "NOM+ACC+DAT" occurring 87 times and "NOM+ACC" occurring 13 times. This quantitative data will flow into the lexicon, documenting both dominant and minority patterns.

---

## Example: Valency Pattern Extraction

**Predicate:** δίδωμι (didōmi) "to give"

**Classical Greek Valency:**

- SUBJ (nominative) + OBJ1 (accusative) + OBJ2 (dative)
- *"X gives Y to Z"*

**Modern Greek Valency:**

- SUBJ + OBJ1 + prepositional phrase (σε + accusative)
- *"X gives Y to Z"* (different realization)

---

## Valency Lexicon Structure

**Each Entry Contains:**
- Lemma (base form) - Time period - Source text - Valency frame(s) - Example sentences - Frequency data

The valency lexicon is structured as a relational database where each predicate entry links to multiple frames, and each frame links to attested examples from the corpus. The database schema will include tables for predicates, frames, arguments, and attestations, allowing complex queries like "all verbs that gained a prepositional complement between Classical and Byzantine periods." This structured approach will enable both linguistic research and computational applications.

---

## Question: What will the database schema look like?


**Technical structure**



---



The relational structure will allow efficient querying across time periods, languages, and semantic classes. Researchers will extract all frames for a given predicate, all predicates with a specific frame type, or all changes between periods. The schema separates abstract frame descriptions from concrete corpus attestations, enabling statistical analysis of frame frequencies.

---

## Question: What are the expected corpus statistics?

**Statistical overview:**

- How many texts total?
- How many tokens?
- What is the distribution across periods?

---

## Corpus Statistics Overview

**Total Corpus Size:**
- **More than 100 texts** across all languages - Approximately **4 million tokens** (words) - Coverage: **3000+ years** of linguistic history

**Greek Subcorpus:** - **50+ texts** from Classical to Modern Greek - Dense coverage of **Koine** and **Byzantine** periods - Multiple versions of key texts (translations, retranslations)

---

## Question: What types of texts are included?

**Genre diversity:**

- What genres are represented?
- Why is genre diversity important?
- How does genre affect valency?

---

## Genre Distribution

**Major Categories:**
- **Religious texts** (Bible, liturgy, patristics): 40% - **Historical/narrative** (chronicles, histories): 25% - **Technical/scientific** (medical, legal): 15% - **Literary** (poetry, fiction): 15% - **Documentary** (papyri, inscriptions): 5%

**Rationale:**
Genre affects language use significantly. By including multiple genres, we can examine the role of genre in variation and change.

---

---

## Question: What is the concept of grammatical multiglossia?

**Multiglossia concept:**

- What does "grammatical multiglossia" mean?
- How does it affect historical texts?
- Why is it important for this research?

---

## Grammatical Multiglossia

**Definition:**

The coexistence of multiple grammatical registers or varieties within a single speech community or textual tradition.

**In Greek Context:**
- Learned texts using archaic grammar - Vernacular texts using contemporary forms - Mixed texts showing both features

**Research Implications:**
- Cannot assume uniform grammar for any period - Must track register alongside time - Translations may show register shifts

---

## Question: How do Byzantine texts reflect multiglossia?

**Byzantine evidence:**

- What registers coexist in Byzantine Greek?
- How do texts vary?
- What does this tell us about language change?

---

## Byzantine Multiglossia Example

**High Register (Learned):**
- Atticizing style imitating Classical Greek - Preserved case system - Archaic vocabulary

**Low Register (Vernacular):**
- Simplified case system - Analytic constructions - Contemporary vocabulary

**Mixed Texts:**
- Chronicles often show both features - Religious texts vary by purpose - Official documents vs. private correspondence

---

## Question: What role do Byzantine chronicles play?

**Chronicle significance:**

- Why are chronicles valuable?
- What linguistic features do they show?
- Which chronicles are included?

---

## Byzantine Chronicles in the Corpus

**Included Chronicles:**
- **Malalas' Chronicle** (6th century) - **Theophanes' Chronicle** (9th century) - **Chronicle of Morea** (14th century)


**Linguistic Value:**

- Narrative prose (natural syntax) - Range of registers - Datable compositions - Evidence for vernacular features

Chronicles are particularly valuable because they often show more colloquial features than theological or literary texts.

---

## Question: What are the key findings so far?


- What patterns have emerged?
- What changes are documented?
- What surprises have been found?

---

## Preliminary Research Findings

**Documented Patterns:**
- **Dative loss:** Systematic across verb classes - **Infinitive replacement:** By να + finite verb - **Preposition increase:** Compensating for case loss - **Word order shifts:** More fixed SVO patterns

**Unexpected Findings:**
- Earlier vernacular features in "learned" texts - Translation influence on standard grammar - Register-specific preservation of archaic forms   

---

## Question: Can you show a specific example of valency change?

**Case study:**

- Which verb shows clear change?
- What are the before/after patterns?
- When did the change occur?

---

## Case Study: The Verb πείθω (peíthō) 'to persuade'

**Classical Greek:**

- Active: NOM + ACC (persuade someone) - Middle: NOM + DAT (obey someone)

**Byzantine Greek:**

- Active: unchanged - Middle: NOM + ACC (dative lost)

**Modern Greek:**

- NOM + ACC only - Middle: NOM + PP   (semantic change)

This verb illustrates the broader pattern of dative loss affecting verb valency.

---

## Question: What other verb classes show similar changes?

**Verb class patterns:**

- Which semantic classes change most?
- Are some classes more stable?
- What predicts change?

---

## Verb Classes and Valency Change

**Most Changed Classes:**
- **Ditransitive verbs:** Dative recipient → prepositional phrase - **Verbs of perception:** Genitive → accusative - **Impersonal verbs:** Dative experiencer → nominative subject

**Most Stable Classes:**
- **Basic transitive verbs:** NOM + ACC preserved - **Motion verbs:** Directional arguments stable - **Speech verbs:** Core arguments unchanged

Semantic factors (animacy, volitionality) influence which argument marking changes.  

---

## Question: How does translation influence valency patterns?

**Translation effects:**

- Do translations show different patterns?
- Can translation introduce new structures?
- How long do translation effects last?

---

## Translation Effects on Valency

**Observed Effects:**
- **Source language calques:** Hebrew patterns in Septuagint Greek  - **Conservatism:** Translations often preserve archaic structures   - **Innovation:** New constructions to render foreign structures

**Example:**
The Hebrew cognate accusative construction (e.g., "he feared a great fear") appears in Septuagint Greek but is rare in native Greek texts.
**Research Question:**
Did Septuagint Greek influence later Byzantine developments?

---

## Question: What about English valency change?

**English comparison:**

- How has English valency changed?
- What parallels Greek?
- What differs?

---

## English Valency Change: Parallels to Greek

**Similar Patterns:**
- Case loss (Old English → Middle English) - Increased preposition use - Fixed word order development

**Differences:** 
- English: Almost complete case loss - Greek: Retained nominative/accusative distinction - English: Stronger word order constraints

**Research Value:**
Comparison reveals which changes are language-specific vs. typologically common.

---

## Question: What computational challenges exist?

**Technical challenges:**

- What are the main processing difficulties?
- How are historical languages handled?
- What NLP limitations exist?

---

## Computational Challenges
**Historical Language Processing:**
- **Limited training data** for NLP models - **Orthographic variation** (no standardization) - **Ambiguity** without native speaker intuition

**Solutions:**  
- Custom models trained on annotated historical texts - Rule-based preprocessing for normalization - Human-in-the-loop verification - Cross-linguistic transfer learning

Modern NLP achieves 90%+ accuracy on modern languages; historical languages can reach 80% with specialized models???
